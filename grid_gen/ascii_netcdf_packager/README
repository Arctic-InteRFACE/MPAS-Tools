Readme for ascii_to_netcdf_packager.cpp

Author: Doug Jacobsen <douglasj@lanl.gov>

Purpose:
	ascii_to_netcdf_packager.cpp is a piece of software designed create a NetCDF
	file that contains enough information to build an MPAS mesh from.

Requirements:
	ascii_to_netcdf_packager.cpp requires the c++ netcdf libraries to be able to read/write NetCDF files.
	It has been tested using g++ version 4.8.1

Usage of ascii_to_netcdf_packager.cpp:
	./AsciiNetCDFPackager.x [mod]

	Input options are:
		[mod] (Optional) -- This allows the output mesh name to be modified
							from grid.N.nc to grid.mod.N.nc

	This program reads three ascii files from the current directory:
		* end_points.dat - This file should contain the x, y, and z coordinates
						   for every cell center in the mesh. Each row is a
						   point, and the columns are order x y z.

		* triangles.dat - This file contains the indices for cells that make up
						  each triangle. Each row is a triangle listing the
						  indices for each cell that is a vertex of the
						  triangle. Each column is an index of a triangle
						  vertex.

		* point_density.dat - This file contains the value of the density
							  function evaluated at each cell center.

	Upon completion, this program will create a new file named grid.N.nc that
	contains enough information to build an MPAS mesh using the
	MpasMeshConverter.x program.

	In the file name, N will be replaced with the number of cells in the mesh.
