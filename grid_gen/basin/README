Program: basin

This program reads in a MPAS grid file (grid.nc) and outputs a modified grid file 
(ocean.nc) and it's associated graph.info files for partitions from 2 up to 1024 in powers of 2.

The purpose of this code is to remove grid cells from any valid MPAS grid, and to 
add initial condition variables like h, u, u_src, forcing, and tracers. 
Please see source file src/basin.F to define the specifics of the output grid file.

The required files are:
  grid.nc is an mpas grid, either spherical or Cartesian
  namelist.basin may point to a standard case in the namelists directory.

After grid.nc and namelist.basin files has been placed in this directory, 
simply run the script runit.

This script will compile basin, run basin (producing an ocean.nc file) and use metis
to partition the graph.info file.

The metis portion of the script requires the executable kmetis to be in your path. 
If it is not, none of the graph.info.part.N files will be created, but can later be
created manually using metis and the assocaite graph.info file.
