The grid_gen utility converts a set of generating points into a complete MPAS
input file, grid.nc. Additionally, grid_gen creates a graph description file
suitable for use with METIS, plots of the initial Delaunay triangulation and
final Delaunay triangulation (after any further adjustment by grid_gen), and a
list of the final generating points.



Input files:

     namelist.input - a Fortran namelist with the following variables
           np - the number of generating points in the locs.dat input file
           locs_as_xyz - whether the generating points are given as (x,y,z) 
                  coordinates or as (lat,lon) coordinates
           n_scvt_iterations - the number of Lloyd iterations to perform, 
                  beginning with the generating points in the locs.dat file, 
                  using the density function specified programmatically in 
                  src/module_scvt.F 

     locs.dat - a list of generating points, either given as (lat,lon) 
           coordinates or as (x,y,z) coordinates; the coorinates used in the 
           file should be indicated to grid_gen using the locs_as_xyz logical 
           value in the namelist.input file.

	   The format of the file for (x,y,z) coordinates has a header line
           giving the number of generating points and the maximum degree of any 
           node in the Delaunay triangulation, followed by np lines with the 
           format '(10x,f22.10,f23.10,f23.10)' giving the x, y, and z 
           coordinates (on the unit sphere) of each generating point.

           The format of the file for (lat,lon) coordinates has np lines with 
           the format '(f13.10,1x,f13.10)' giving the latitude and longitude 
           coorinates of each generating point.



Output files:

     scvt_initial.ps - a plot of the Delaunay triangulation of the generating 
           points specified in the locs.dat file
 
     scvt_final.ps - a plot of the Delaunay triangulation of the final
           generating points, after adjustment by the number of Lloyd iterations
           specified in the namelist.input file
 
     locs.dat.out - a list of the final generating points, after adjustment by 
           the number of Lloyd iterations specified in the namelist.input file
 
     graph.info - a description of the output mesh in a format suitable for use
           with METIS to produce graph decomposition files for MPAS
 
     grid.nc - an MPAS input file
