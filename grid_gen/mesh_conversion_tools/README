Readme for mpas_mesh_converter.cpp and mpas_cell_culler.cpp

Author: Doug Jacobsen <douglasj@lanl.gov>

Purpose:
	mpas_mesh_converter.cpp is a piece of software designed create an MPAS mesh.
	As input, this software takes the locations of MPAS cell centers, and cell
	vertices, along with the connectivity array cellsOnVertex. If provided, it
	will also migrate data from the meshDensity field, if it's not present it
	will write 1.0 for every cell.

	mpas_cell_culler.cpp is a piece of software designed remove
	cells/edge/vertices from an MPAS mesh.  As input, this software takes a
	valid MPAS mesh with one additional field "cullCell". This new field should
	be nCells integers. A 1 means the cell should be kept, and a 0 means the
	cell should be removed.
	
Requirements:
	mpas_mesh_converter.cpp requires the c++ netcdf libraries to be able to read/write a NetCDF files.
	It also requires the tr1 headers for c++, specifically unordered_set.
	It has been tested using g++ version 4.8.1

	mpas_cell_culler.cpp requires the c++ netcdf libraries to be able to read/write a NetCDF files.
	It has been tested using g++ version 4.8.1

Usage of mpas_mesh_converter.cpp:
	./MpasMeshConverter.x [input_name] [output_name]

	input_name:
		The input_name should be the name of a NetCDF file containing the following information.
			Dimensions:
				nCells - The number of cells described in the file.
				nVertices - The number of vertices described in the file.
				vertexDegree - The maximum number of cells that surround each vertex.
			Variables:
				xCell -- The x location of every cell center.
				yCell -- The y location of every cell center.
				zCell -- The z location of every cell center.
				xVertex -- The x location of every vertex (cell corner).
				yVertex -- The y location of every vertex (cell corner).
				zVertex -- The z location of every vertex (cell corner).
				cellsOnVertex -- A list of cell indices that border each vertex (Dimensioned vertexDegree * nVertices).
								 This list can contain -1 values if the dual cell is not complete (e.g. a line rather than a triangle).
				meshDensity -- (Optional) The value of the generating density function at each cell center.
							   If this variable is ommitted, it is filled with 1.0 on output.
			Global Attributes:
				on_a_sphere -- Should be "YES" if the cells/vertices are defined on a sphere and "NO" if they are defined in a plane.
				history -- (Optional) Should be defined to a string describing how the input file was generated.
				mesh_id -- (Optional) Should be a 40 character string (Alpha-Numeric) that can be used to identify the mesh.
						   If ommitted, a random string will be placed in the output file.
	output_name:
		The output_name should be the name of the NetCDF file that will be generated. It will be a valid MPAS mesh.
		No initial conditions are placed in this file.


Usage of mpas_cell_culler.cpp:
	./MpasCellCuller.x [input_name] [output_name]

	input_name:
		The input name should be the name of a NetCDF file that is a fully valid MPAS file.
		It is required to have all of the fields an output file from MpasMeshConverter.x contains.
		There is one additional field:
		cullCell -- (Optional) Should be dimensioned nCells. Should contain a 1 for all cells that should be removed
					and a 0 for all cells that should be kept.

	output_name:
		The output_name should be the name of the NetCDF file that will be generated. It will be the same as the input file,
		with cells, edges, and vertices removed where appropriate. Also, the cullCell field will be removed.


Notes for mpas_mesh_converter.cpp:
	- The output mesh should have an attribute "mesh_spec" which defined which
		version of the MPAS Mesh Specification this mesh conforms to.
	- Cells that are not complete (e.g. are not surrounded by vertices) will be
		given a negative area.
	- Negative area cells can be removed at a later state to remove non-complete
		cells.
	

Notes for mpas_cell_culler.cpp:
	- Cells that contain negative area will be removed in addition to all cells that have
		a cullCell value of 1.
