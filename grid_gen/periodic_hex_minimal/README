This dir contains a version of the orginal periodic hex code that creats a "minimal" grid.nc file
to be then processed using the mesh convergion tool ("mpas_mesh_converter.cpp" in the 
"grid_gen/mesh_conversion_tools/" subdir). E.g., invoking ...

> mpas_mesh_converter ./grid.nc

...will create a full mpas mesh called "mesh.nc".

These alterations were made to greatly speed up the mesh generation process for large meshes. In 
periodic_grid.F, only the necessary fields are constructed and written to netcdf, and these are 
allocated, written, and deallocated in sequence to minimze the memory footprint. In 
module_write_netcdf.F, the minimal number of fields are included and all fields are optional so
that the netcdf write command can be called as many times as needed in periodic_grid.F.
