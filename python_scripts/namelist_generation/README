About:
	This script (parse_xml_registry.py) parses a MPAS Registry.xml file.
	It generates a default namelist file (named namelist.input.generated)
	based on the default values in Registry.xml.

	In addition, it can be used to generate documentation for a users or developers guide.


	It can be run by calling it with
		./parse_xml_registry.py -f path/to/Registry.xml
	With two optional arguments
		-d path/to/latex/section/desctiptions
		and
		-p path/in/users/guide/to/section/descriptions

	The -d flag lists a path in the file system to a set of section
	descriptions for providing additional information in the output latex
	documentation.

	Section descriptions are required to be named whatever the section is. For
	example, in a namelist, there might be a namelist record named
	"&time_management". The script searches the directory listed with the -d
	flag for a latex file named time_management.tex, and adds an input line to
	the output latex documentation to include this file.

	The -p flag allows the user to specify the relative path inside the latex
	documentation where the file should be input from. As an example, one might
	run it as follows to generate the ocean core's documentation.

		./parse_xml_registry.xml -f mpas_root/src/core_ocean/Registry.xml -d mpas_doc_root/users_guide/ocean/section_descriptions -p ocean/section_descriptions
	

	On output, several files are created which are listed below.
		namelist.input.generated - A default namelist.input file for the core that owns the Registry.xml file.
		dimensions.tex - A tabulated description of the dimensions for the core.
		namelist_table_documentation.tex - A tabulated description of the namelist options for the core.
		namelist_section_documentation.tex - A more detailed section format description of the namelist options for the core.
		variable_table_documentation.tex - A tabulated description of the variables in the core.
		variable_section_documentation.tex - A more detailed section formate description of the variable in the core.
		define_version.tex - A simple file which can be included to define \version inside the users guide.
