This script parses a MPAS Registry.xml file to generates documentation for a
users or developers guide.

Typical usage is as follows::

    # set the core, one of ocean, landice, cice, etc.
    exoprt CORE=<core>
    # Set your repo directories:
    export MPAS_REPO=~/repos/MPAS
    export MPAS_TOOLS_REPO=~/repos/MPAS-Tools
    export MPAS_DOCUMENTS_REPO=~/repos/MPAS-Documents
    cd $MPAS_REPO
    # Compile MPAS so you have a src/core_ocean/Registry_processed.xml file.
    # Change the compiler as needed.
    make CORE=$CORE gfortran
    cd $MPAS_DOCUMENTS_REPO/users_guide/$CORE
    $MPAS_TOOLS_REPO/python_scripts/namelist_generation/parse_xml_registry.py \
      -f $MPAS_REPO/src/core_${CORE}/Registry_processed.xml \
      -d section_descriptions -p ${CORE}/section_descriptions
    cd ..
    make clean CORE=$CORE
    make CORE=$CORE

The -f flag points to the processed registry file (typically with a full path).

The -d flag points to the local or full path to .tex files that containing
section descriptions for providing additional information in the output latex
documentation.

Section descriptions are required to be named whatever the section is. For
example, in a namelist, there might be a namelist record named
"&time_management". The script searches the directory listed with the -d
flag for a latex file named time_management.tex, and adds an input line to
the output latex documentation to include this file.

The -p flag specifies the relative path inside the latex documentation where
the file should be input from. As an example, one might
run it as follows to generate the ocean core's documentation::

    ./parse_xml_registry.xml -f mpas_root/src/core_ocean/Registry.xml \
        -d mpas_doc_root/users_guide/ocean/section_descriptions \
        -p ocean/section_descriptions

On output, several files are created which are listed below.
    namelist.input.generated - A default namelist.input file for the core that
                               owns the Registry.xml file.
    dimensions.tex - A tabulated description of the dimensions for the core.
    namelist_table_documentation.tex - A tabulated description of the namelist
                                       options for the core.
    namelist_section_documentation.tex - A more detailed section format
                                         description of the namelist options
                                         for the core.
    variable_table_documentation.tex - A tabulated description of the variables
                                       in the core.
    variable_section_documentation.tex - A more detailed section formate
                                         description of the variable in the
                                         core.
    define_version.tex - A simple file which can be included to define \version
                         inside the users guide.
