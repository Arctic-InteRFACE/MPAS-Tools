plot_mpas_cross_sections README

This is a matlab post-processing tool to view cross sections of
MPAS-Ocean data.  To begin, change the parameters at the top of
plot_mpas_cross_sections.m.  You will need to change the text strings
wd, sim(i).dir, and sim(i).netcdf_file so that the text string

[wd '/' sim(i).dir '/' sim(i).netcdf_file ] is the file path,

where wd is the working directory and dir is the run directory.
Details of the section coordinates and variables may be specified in
plot_mpas_cross_sections.m.  

The data files only need to contain a small number of variables.
You may need to reduce the file size before copying to a local
machine using:

ncks -v acc_uReconstructMeridional,acc_uReconstructZonal, \
nAccumulate,latVertex,lonVertex,verticesOnEdge,edgesOnVertex,hZLevel,\
dvEdge,latCell,lonCell,cellsOnCell,nEdgesOnCell \
file_in.nc file_out.nc

After plot_mpas_cross_sections is executed in matlab, plots are placed
in the docs/*.nc_dir/f subdirectory, and a latex file is created and
compiled to produce a docs/*.nc_dir/*.nc.pdf file that includes all
the figures.

This plotting tool has been tested for ocean output files, but should
nearly work for other cores as well.  A few lines will need to be
changed.  We compute depth from the hZLevel variable, and plot cross
sections with depth increasing downward.
